## Professional Experience

### PostDoc in Algorithm Engineering — KIT
*Since December 2020*

Focus: static approximate membership query & retrieval (perfect hash static function) data structures.  About to publish a static AMQ with sub-1% space overhead and query times on the order of a single cache miss.

Other Responsibilities include supervising BSc and MSc thesis projects and course work, coordinating a high-performance computing (HPC) project, and leading seminars and exercises.

### Doctoral Researcher — KIT
*December 2014 – November 2020, Algorithm Engineering Group*

Focus: Parallel & Distributed Algorithms for Big Data Problems

Thesis: [Communication-Efficient Probabilistic Algorithms: Selection, Sampling, and Checking](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000127719), Advisor: Peter Sanders

Designed, analysed, and implemented probabilistic run-time correctness verification for fundamental operations (aggregations, sorting, ...) in [Thrill](https://project-thrill.org), an Apache Spark-like research prototype [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08255)

Presented the first parallel algorithm for constructing alias tables, a popular data structure for sampling from discrete distributions and an open problem for decades; the first algorithm that requires time linear in the output size for sampling with replacement from discrete distributions [[2]](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/11180/)

Developed communication-efficient algorithms for various selection problems, bulk priority queues, and (weighted) reservoir sampling [[3]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03942), [[4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11069)
