<p style="margin-top:-1.5em">
Lorenz is an Algorithm Engineer for Big Data, algorithms researcher, and experienced high-performance modern C++ programmer.  He works as a Software Engineer on Firebolt's Query Processing team, building the cloud data warehouse of the future.  Before that, he completed his PhD thesis at KIT.  His research focuses on probabilistic distributed algorithms for Big Data problems.

## Professional Experience

### Software Engineer — Firebolt Analytics
*Since September 2021*

Working on the vectorised query engine of Firebolt's cloud data warehouse, including feature development, performance optimisation, and stability.

&nbsp;

### PostDoc in Algorithm Engineering — KIT
*December 2020 – September 2021*

Focus: static approximate membership query & retrieval (perfect hash static function) data structures.  Designed and implemented [BuRR (bumped ribbon retrieval)](https://github.com/lorenzhs/BuRR/), a retrieval and static approximate membership query (AMQ) data structure with sub-1% space overhead and query times on the order of a single cache miss.

Other Responsibilities included supervising BSc and MSc thesis projects and course work, coordinating a high-performance computing (HPC) project, and leading seminars and exercises.

&nbsp;

### Doctoral Researcher — KIT
*December 2014 – November 2020, Algorithm Engineering Group*

Focus: Parallel & Distributed Algorithms for Big Data Problems

Thesis: [Communication-Efficient Probabilistic Algorithms: Selection, Sampling, and Checking](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000127719), Advisor: Peter Sanders

Designed, analysed, and implemented probabilistic run-time correctness verification for fundamental operations (aggregations, sorting, ...) in [Thrill](https://project-thrill.org), an Apache Spark-like research prototype [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08255)

Presented the first parallel algorithm for constructing alias tables, a popular data structure for sampling from discrete distributions and an open problem for decades; the first algorithm that requires time linear in the output size for sampling with replacement from discrete distributions [[2]](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/11180/)

Developed communication-efficient algorithms for various selection problems, bulk priority queues, and (weighted) reservoir sampling [[3]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03942), [[4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11069)
