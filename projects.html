                I'm a (final year) computer science student with strong interest in algorithm engineering.
                Currently I'm studying at the University of Leicester in the MSc programme <em>"Advanced Computational Methods"</em>, which I am due to finish later this year.
                Apart from my studies, I contribute to some great open source projects like Glowing Bear.

            Glowing Bear strives to provide a modern IRC experience, right in the browser, wherever you are. Some people would probably call this "cloud", but as I'll detail below, that's not entirely true.
            </p>
            <span>What Glowing Bear isn't:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>A standalone IRC client (it's a <a href="http://www.weechat.org/">WeeChat</a> relay plugin)</li>
                <li>Hosted IRC</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <span>What it is and does:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>An IRC frontend running in your browser, talking directly to your WeeChat instance via WebSockets</li>
                <li>Soon, it will also be an Android app that provides a better native experience on your phone or tablet</li>
                <li>Supports fully SSL-encrypted communication with your server</li>
                <li>Fully IPv6 capable, of course</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            While it provides most of what you would expect from an IRC client in the cloud, it's not: Glowing Bear connects to <em>your</em> WeeChat instance (most likely running on a machine that <em>you</em> control). Glowing Bear is pure client-side JavaScript, connecting directly to <em>your</em> server, and your server only. This means that <em>you</em> are in control 100% of the way.
            </p>

            <p>
            I joined the Glowing Bear team in December of 2013, a time in which I was looking for an in-browser IRC frontend. At the time, I was running irssi in a terminal multiplexer on a shell server, ssh'ing in there every time I needed it. This seems to be a fairly common approach, yet it felt unnecessarily clunky and the mobile experience was horrible. So I went out to look for a replacement. My friend <a href="https://xhochy.com">xhochy</a> suggested <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/">IRCCloud</a>, which is pretty neat, but I wanted a self-hosted, open source solution and didn't feel like paying 4€ a month for IRC. There turned out to be quite a few projects in that direction – some including their own IRC client, some building on top of existing clients –, but Glowing Bear is the one I liked best. It's simple, easy to set up, easy to use and understand, and worked pretty well already, although a bit rough around the edges.
            </p>
            <p>
            Shortly after, I began contributing bits and pieces, like sorting channels by server, a per-buffer input history, or an improved mobile experience. You can try the <a href="https://glowing-bear.github.io/glowing-bear">GitHub hosted version</a> if you want to give it a spin. Recently, I've started developing a native Android app with <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> to leverage the full power of native apps like notifications. There's even a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glowing_bear">developer preview</a> in the Google Play Store!

            For my BSc thesis at the <a href="http://i11www.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/">Group Algorithms 1</a> at <a href="http://www.kit.edu/">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a>, I developed <a href="http://i11www.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/_media/teaching/theses/files/ba-huebschle-13.pdf">a novel approach for route planning for electric vehicles</a>. Using real-world map, elevation, and energy consumption data, it can compute optimal routes within seconds. In contrast to other algorithms, the method I proposed is fully geared towards the requirements of electric vehicles. It considers not only travel time and energy consumption (<i>battery drain</i>), but also the speed driven along each road. Therefore, it computes a comprehensive set of routes, from which the driver can pick the one that best suits their requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have since further optimised the implementation in collaboration with my advisors, and added another very efficient heuristic method to further reduce running times to sub-second values at minimal cost to the solutions' quality.

        <h2><em>Small Projects and Short Hacks</em></h2>
        <small>
            These projects are small or were built in a short period of time, e.g. a weekend project, and may not be developed anymore thereafter.
            Nevertheless I will try to keep them running and everything uploaded for documentation.
            I should probably add a whole lot of stuff that I currently don't remember to this list

            Ever needed a VPN right now? With instavpn, you'll be connected in just a minute! Using <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle">sshuttle</a>, instavpn provides you with a dirt cheap working VPN within sixty seconds. It'll even tear down the host once you're done, so you only pay for what you use. That's only $0.007 an hour with DigitalOcean's current pricing, or $0.21 per month if you use it for an hour every day!
            </p>
            <p>
            So what does it do? Using the DigitalOcean API, it creates a new droplet in your account. DigitalOcean promise that this will take at most 55 seconds. Then, it connects you to your new machine using sshuttle, a zero-setup transparent proxy server that forwards over SSH. That accounts for the remaining 5 seconds. Once you're done, simply Ctrl+C out of it, and it'll destroy your droplet so you won't pay any more than necessary. There's even a self-destruct mechanism should you lose the connection!

            A small script to teach hubot message relaying. Suppose I want to highlight someone in a group chat (Campfire, IRC, XMPP, and several dozen other chat protocols are supported), but they're not online. Hubot-tell teaches hubot, GitHub's open source life embetterment robot, to do exactly that. It even supports multiple recipients and different command aliases.
